# Protohackers in elixir 

This is a list of videos done by [Andrea Leopardi](https://www.youtube.com/@whatyouhide) where he solves Protohackers challenges using Elixir.
There is a youtube video list. 


In the videos he assumes you already know Elixir and it syntaxis, but as there are a lot of resources to learn that I think this is still 
a valuable source of knowledge because I always feel like laking of target to learn Elixir, and every time I have tried to learn it I have
feel like if I forget everythin because it has no meaning to me right now.
